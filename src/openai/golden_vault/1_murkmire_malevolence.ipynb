This object, known as the Murkmire Stone, has been acquired by the Varkenbluff Museum of Natural History and is due to be displayed in just a few days. However, Dr. Dannell has reason to believe that the stone is actually an egg of an eldritch creature that could wipe out entire villages if it hatches. With the university and museum authorities refusing to listen to her warnings, it's up to you to help Dr. Dannell save the city of Varkenbluff from a catastrophic event. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to infiltrate the museum, retrieve the Murkmire Stone, and find a way to neutralize its contents before it's too late.

She looks worried as she explains the situation: A few weeks ago, she discovered a light-green stone during a dig in the Murkmire, but it turned out to be an eldritch horror egg that will hatch tonight at midnight. The university and museum ignored her warnings, and she was fired after attempting to steal the egg to contain it. Now, with the egg on the cusp of hatching and the Murkmire Stone exhibit opening tomorrow, the city is in danger. She needs your help to steal the Murkmire Stone from the museum and bring it back to her so she can encase the egg in a crystal box. She provides you with a map of the museum and gala tickets to the private exhibit tonight, as well as formal attire from her heirloom bag of holding. She offers 20 gold pieces per character plus her bag of holding as a reward for success, with the potential for an increase if you can persuade her.

A detect magic spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around the pedestal, and the glyphs carved into the base release arcane lock spells on all doors leading into the room if the stone is removed. The unlocked doors will then close and lock, with the exception of the curator and museum guards. You notice\n"

      "The museum gala celebrating the opening of the Murkmire Stone exhibition is a private event that begins at 6 p.m. and ends at 8 p.m. Before attending, characters must retrieve or procure formal attire and stash their weapons and visible armor. The museum's facade boasts enormous columns and elegant archways hewn from marble, while cosmopolitan visitors bustle about the entrance, including some clad in sleek formalwear.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the first part of the gala, characters can explore the public areas of the museum and prepare for the heist before the museum closes at 8 p.m. Museum guards notice anyone not immediately heading to the Gemstone Wing, where the Murkmire Stone is ensconced. The doors to the museumâ€™s offices and basement are locked at all hours, and any characters caught entering a restricted area or causing a public incident are escorted from the museum.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the museum closes, the characters can hide in various locations, such as cleaning supply storage, privies, attic, or basement. If the characters decide to leave the museum and sneak back inside after hours, they can either pick the front doors' lock, enter through the attic skylight, or pry open the loading dock doors. During the gala, the characters can interact with other attendees and the museum's curator, Alda Arkin, who holds a map of the museum guardsâ€™ after-hours stations, a master key to the museumâ€™s locked doors, and a pass card that allows her to bypass the museumâ€™s alarms. \n",

      "Overall, the opening gala of the Murkmire Stone exhibition is a sophisticated event that requires careful planning and stealthy movements. The museum's tight security and various security measures, including alarms, animated statues, and Gemstone Wing defenses, make it a challenging heist for characters looking to acquire the Murkmire Stone.\n"
