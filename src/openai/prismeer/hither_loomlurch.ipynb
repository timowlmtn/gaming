      "4. Climax/Boss Battle: This is the final challenge of the dungeon, typically a boss battle or other high-stakes encounter that requires players to use all their skills and resources to overcome. This challenge should feel like a true climax, with high stakes and a sense of danger.\n",

The room is cluttered with items and hoarded treasures like a spell scroll of speak with plants and a set of four silver teaspoons engraved with pained facial expressions. However, the three armchairs in the room are trained mimics in disguise, magically compelled to adhere to creatures only when Granny Nightshade orders them to do so. The hag makes children craft nightmarish toys in the adjacent workshop (area L4), where flickering lanterns illuminate a cluttered workspace filled with soft, ambient music produced by bells and chimes. The boggles that lurk in the shadows intend to play pranks on visitors while awaiting their potential freedom.\n"
