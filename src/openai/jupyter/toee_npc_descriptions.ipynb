      "Canoness Yday is an aged cleric who maintains the largest Temple in town. She is a human acolyte with a background in knowledge and wisdom. Yday was instrumental in the fall of the Temple of Elemental Evil and its completed defeat a few years later. She suspects there was more to that Temple than she and her allies saw. Yday is aware that a great demon that lived within is gone now, but she spends waking nights now and again wondering what \"elemental evil\" truly represented and what the truth behind the forces and funding of the Temple. No one can get in to see Yday without first speaking to Calmer, who casts detect Evil on any wishing audience. Calmer is Yday's assistant and trusted friend. Terjon, the second-in-command, is an adventurer at heart. He prefers that Yday manage the Temple's affairs so that he can go on expeditions. About one-quarter of the time, he is off on a quest for something or other. Derim is a new acolyte who keeps quiet and observes, learning the hierarchy of the church and, indeed, the town. \n",
