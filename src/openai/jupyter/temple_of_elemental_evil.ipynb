      "Pendant de nombreuses années, un culte du mal chaotique a prospéré quelque part sur les rives du Myr Dyv. Bien que l'emplacement du temple soit perdu, ces faits à son sujet et sur ses adeptes sont connus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le culte était basé sur la prémisse que les forces élémentaires de l'univers sont chaotiques et opposées à l'humanité, c'est-à-dire maléfiques. Le temple du culte cherchait à détruire toutes les œuvres du bien et à perturber l'ordre. Ses membres étaient des voleurs, des assassins, des brigands et autres. Le feu était considéré comme le premier mal élémentaire, et son penchant pour les événements chaotiques s'inscrivait dans la prémisse du culte.\n",
      "\n",
      "De même, l'eau était vénérée comme une force encore plus puissante du mal chaotique, l'eau sous forme d'inondations, de tempêtes et de mers déchaînées, battant les terres et coulant les navires. L'apogée du mal chaotique était cependant considérée comme une combinaison d'air et de terre - représentée par le noir et correspondant à l'abîme démoniaque. Cette combinaison était considérée comme la négation complète de la matière.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le culte est devenu puissant et riche, attirant les adeptes du pire genre et leur offrant sécurité dans les murs de sa forteresse-temple. De cette forteresse, ces adeptes chevauchaient pour voler, piller et dévaster les terres environnantes, dîmant le culte avec les butins de ces brigandages. Les captifs de ces raids étaient ramenés au temple pour servir de sacrifices humains (enfants au feu, hommes à l'eau, femmes au mal noir) ou pour esclavagiser leur vie. Outre les vastes travaux supérieurs du temple, un labyrinthe profond sous le lieu a été construit, mais presque rien n'est maintenant connu de ces donjons, sinon qu'il y avait des créatures habitées servant à la fois le chaos et le mal. On raconte qu'un démon a pris domicile dans le niveau le plus profond afin de mieux recevoir les sacrifices qui lui étaient destinés.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finalement, les voisins de ce temple se sont lassés des déprédations. Tout le bien, le légal et le chaotique se sont unis sous la forme d'une armée puissante. Leur armée a marché vers le temple, combattant deux batailles en chemin. La première était inconclusive, bien que les forces du bien aient tenu le champ par la suite, de sorte qu'elles ont acquis la réputation de la victoire, et leurs rangs ont été gonflés par de nombreux hommes de la région. La deuxième bataille a vu un grand massacre de kobolds, de gobelins, d'orcs, de hobgoblins, d'hommes maléfiques et autres. Le temple a ensuite été assiégé, est tombé et ses habitants ont été mis à mort. Certaines sources rapportent que le temple et ses environs ont résisté à une destruction complète, mais la majorité affirme que le tout a été rasé pour que le culte ne puisse jamais émerger à nouveau ni trouver où il avait autrefois prospéré.\n"

    "THE MOATHOUSE\n",
    "Now a ruined keep of small size, the moathouse has an exciting history of battles and monsters. It lies approximately ten miles east of Hommlet, on the road toward the deserted town of Nulb. An overgrown and rugged two miles long path leads off the main road to the moathouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "MOATHOUSE HISTORY\n",
    "When the Temple of Elemental Evil was built, this keep arose at the point where their evil influence reached the farthest west. It was a great deal of work because the area was wet and unstable. The builders had to drain the surrounding lands and dig down to the limestone to build a foundation (once they did, they allowed the water to return, channeling it into a moat around the fortress). The construction crews complained and whined, \"Why here?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that this fortress is over the site of an ancient shrine to Tharizdun. In time-lost days, clerics of the Dark God erected a great obelisk within a natural cave to commune with their deity. Then, when Tharizdun was imprisoned, they sealed the cave and diverted a minor underground stream so that even if the top of the shaft leading down to the cave were discovered, it would appear to be a pool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original master of the place was a cultist of the Dark God named Noustan. As a cleric of Zuggtmoy, he compelled the forces of Elemental Evil to build here. The moathouse served its purpose, but each time the forces of good struggled against Elemental Evil, this outpost was the last to fall. The first time, when the moathouse was still new, a pitched battle between two sizable forces tore gaping holes in the walls, destroying the mostly wooden sections of the main structure, and the place was looted. The second time, as the temple was rebuilding itself, a particularly devious and vile cleric named Lareth deBeautiful took control of the moathouse. Lareth commanded a small number of troops, primarily humans and bugbears, who occupied only the dungeon of the moathouse. Shrewd and opportunistic, Lareth professed to serve both Lloth and Zuggtmoy at various times but was actually a cleric ofTharizdun. He and his servants were slain by the small band of heroes who helped defeat the temple with the aid of locals such as Y'dey and Elmo (see Chapter 1: The Town of Hommlet).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since then, the moathouse has fallen even worse, and the dungeon has been relatively quiet except for the ghouls and ghasts. Unfortunately, these horrors are always present, no matter how many are destroyed (due to the influence of Tharizdun's shrine, but no one knows that). Occasionally Elmo comes out to the place just to make sure 1 is quiet, and Spugnoir (see area 25 in Chapter 1) sometimes explores a\n",
    "few rooms in the dungeon, looking for a magical treasure rumored to belong to Lareth. Over the years, even a few groups of adventurers have stopped by, but they consistently report what everyone else does-nothing new stirs in the moathouse. Until now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delian, or \"ol' Del\" as he refers to himself, wanders the wilderness alone, trapping small animals for food and occasionally going to Hommlet to sell the pelts. The PCs encounter him on his way to town on the road or checking his traps in the wilderness. He's a friendly old guy, grizzled and dirty, usually with a bag full of pelts or dead animals on his shoulder. He doesn't get to talk to people much, so he's willing to chat.\n",
    "If the PCs say anything about the moathouse, Del responds, \"There's a dragon in there! Don't wanna be going there.\"\n",
    "Del saw Utreshimon, a blue dragon, about three days ago (the dragon took up residence in the moathouse the previous week). He has no idea if the dragon has anything to do with the clerics he saw - and it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "If pressed for more information about the moathouse other than the dragon, he says: \"Some folks been pokin' in and outta that old place. Look like holy men to me, except they keep strange company.\"\n",
    "What Del saw was the clerics ofTharizdun who had been\n",
    "exploring and excavating the site for the past three months. The \"strange company\" are gnolls, which Del can identify because enough live in the area for him to be familiar with such creatures. Careful questioning reveals that the gnolls with the clerics were \"more like people\" than most. (Their armor, weapons, and clothing are in good shape and relatively uniform, having been supplied by the clerics.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressed even further, Del says: \"Even before, when that place was quieter, I wouldn't go in there. It's haunted.\"\n",

Instead, it is about 30 feet across--the cave is much larger than that in every direction. Beyond the floor edge, the cave walls plummet farther into darkness.

No light is present, but even characters without darkvision find that they can \"see\" within the darkness here.

While Lareth was slain by adventurers in this room, an even more powerful cleric of the Elder Eel mental Eye, named Hedrack, raised him from the dead soon afterward and spirited him away.
