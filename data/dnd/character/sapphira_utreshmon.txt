Sapphira, the elven countess, is a vision of unsettling beauty. Weaves of blue and silver adorn her long
hair that cascades down her back. Her wide, cerullian blue eyes seem to sparkle with electric energy.

Dressed entirely in shades of blue, Sapphira exudes an air of elegance and regality. Her gown, made from the finest
silk, hugs her graceful figure and drapes around her in soft, flowing layers. Intricate silver embroidery traces
delicate patterns across the fabric, reminiscent of winding vines and blooming flowers.

Adorned with jewelry shaped into reptilian motifs.  A silver claw that clasps her billowing dress, shimmering
blue sapphires that sparkle with an eletric energy.  A silver bracelet in the shape of a serpent winds up her
forearm.  A circlet rests on her brow with an empty silver setting where you would expect a jewel.

With every movement, Sapphira exudes an aura of elegance and power, her gestures graceful and deliberate.
Her voice is melodic, akin to the soothing whispers of a babbling brook, and her laughter carries a tinkling
quality that delights all those fortunate enough to hear it.

In her presence, one cannot help but feel captivated by her enchanting aura and the sense of ancient wisdom that
emanates from her very being. Sapphira, the elven countess dressed in shades of blue, is a sight to behold and a
figure that lingers in the memories of all who have the privilege of encountering her.

Though she seldom shows her draconic form, Sapphira is Utreshmon, a young adult blue dragon in disguise.
She will not hesitate to transform to a fearsome Adult Blue Dragon should someone offend her.
