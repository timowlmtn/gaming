Oseltr Gundigoot (male human, Com6) opened the inn of o believe.) opened the Inn Welcome Wench shortly after the Battle of Emridy Meadows more than twenty years ago. In the old days, he was a ranking figure in the militia and general town administration. The Inn of the Welcome Wench grew in reputation as a place of great comfort and quality, but one whose patrons should expect to pay well for the excellent service and fine food and lodging.

Nowadays, Ostler takes it easy. His heart is weak, and his daughter and wife attempt to shelter him from great excitement or surprises. Ostler's daughter Vestra runs the daily activities. She keeps the inn friendly and warm, making it a welcome dar brow and homey place.

Maridosen, the barkeep, is actually an agent for the secret cult. This black-haired, pale-skinned woman has worked at the inn for two months and knows the town reasonably well. However, she is short-tempered, with little patience for small talk or looks before humor. Vesta will likely fire her within the next month, as she is too coarse for the inn's standards.
