Canoness Ydey maintains this, the largest Temple in town.
The aged cleric was instrumental in the fall of the Temple of
Elemental Evil and its completed defeat a few years later. Ydey
suspects there was more to that Temple than she and her allies saw. She is aware that a great demon that lived
within is gone now, but she spendswaking nights now
and again wondering what "elemental evil" truly represented
and what the truth behind the forces and funding of the
Temple. (She was told then, and it is thought by others now,
that a demonic tyrant of the nearby lands of Iuz controlled
the Temple, but she personally finds that hard to believe.) No
one can get in to see Y'dey without first speaking to Calmer,
who casts detect Evil on any wishing audience.
Calmer is Y'dey'S assistant and trusted friend. He is tall and
well-built but will likely only advance in his
current position. He is aware of this and has long since
accepted it. Calmerisa friend of Spugnoir (see area 25).
Terjon, the second-in-command, is an adventurer at heart.
He prefers that Y'dey manage the Temple's affairs so that he
can go on expeditions. About one-quarter of the time, he is
off n a quest for something or other. He's eager to join good-aligned adventurers for a short-term mission but
won't join a group that is obviously far less skilled than he.
He questions any potential companions to ensure
they are at least 5th level. Terjon is gruff, with dark brown
hair and eyes. Most townsfolk do not care for him, preferring
the softer touch of Y'dey or Calmer.
New to the Temple, the acolyte Derim keeps quiet and
observes, learning h e hierarchy of the church and, indeed, the town. His motives are o t sinister; he simply looks before
he leaps. One day, Derim hopes to be the canon of his
church and an influential leader in Hommlet.
