The Lost Children table identifies the children currently held captive inside Loomlurch and their locations when the characters arrive. As time passes, the children can move about the lair, at your discretion. They stay clear of danger and play no role in combat. All of them are chaotic good.

Children free of Granny Nightshade’s tyranny have no easy way to return home, but they can take refuge at Little Oak’s treehouse or be left in the care of the unicorn Lamorna at Wayward Pool. The dwarf Elkhorn (see area L13) insists on remaining in Thither to care for the children if no one else will. If Zybilna is freed from her stasis, she returns the children to their proper homes.
